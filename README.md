# WedPortal
WedPortal is a super app that composes all the needs of the couple before their wedding

A project that has been done in the Integrative Software Engineering course by six friends and me.
We build a super-app that communicates with other mini-apps we have created.

## Supplier mini app
In this mini-app, suppliers can publish themselves and their services.

## Customer mini app
Couples can look for suppliers and services and order the services they offer

## Tables mini app
In this mini app, couples can arrange the sitting of the guests


The goal of this project is to create one super-app that provides services to the other mini-apps. 
We used Springboot and springWeb to build our Restful API server and used MongoDB as our database. We have written many queries to query our database.
